The Slot Machine Game is a fun and simple project that simulates a classic slot  machine. The player starts with a balance, places bets, and spins the reels. If the  symbols on the reels match, the player wins a payout based on their bet. The  game continues until the player either runs out of money or decides to walk away  with their winnings. 

Payout Rules: 
• If all three symbols match, the player wins 10 times their bet. 
• If two out of three symbols match, the player wins 2 times their bet. 
• If none of the symbols match, the player loses their bet.
